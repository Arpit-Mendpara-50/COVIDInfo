            "newsDescription": "Some of Ontario's largest hospitals are nearing or exceeding full capacity even before flu season and the second wave of COVID-19 bring an expected surge in new patients. Data obtained by CBC News shows that the acute care wards of a dozen major hospitals were filled above 95 per cent of their funded capacity for more than half the days in September and early October.Those rates significantly exceed the province's maximum occupancy target of 85 per cent. That was set earlier this year for hospitals to get the green light to resume scheduled surgeries, such as organ transplants, cancer operations and cardiac surgeries, basically halted during the pandemic's first wave.Many of the hospitals running at or over capacity are in Ottawa and the Greater Toronto Area, the regions hit hardest by COVID-19 cases this fall. However some hospitals outside those regions are also full to bursting, including in Sudbury, Hamilton, the Niagara region, and Peterborough. The data suggests many hospitals have returned to the overcrowding levels seen before the pandemic, when CBC News revealed hospitals filled beyond capacity nearly every single day, with patients housed in hallways, conference rooms and cafeterias not as exceptional cases, but as a matter of routine.

            "newsDescription": "TORONTO -- Workers at a grocery store in the U.S. tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a rate well above the rest of their community, researchers say. The research was published Friday in the journal Occupation and Environmental Medicine. It is based on a study of 104 adults who were working at a grocery store in the Boston area in May, when they underwent mandatory testing over three days Of the 104 workers tracked, 21 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Only five of the 21 workers who tested positive were displaying symptoms of COVID-19 at the time. With the vast majority of cases both asymptomatic and involving personnel who interact with shoppers, the researchers suggest that this puts both other workers and the public at large at risk.

            "newsDescription": "The COVID-19 symptom list for Albertans under the age of 18 has changed. As of Nov. 2, runny nose and sore throat have been removed from the list of symptoms that require mandatory isolation for children. Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said the changes to the symptom list are intended to get children and teenagers back into child care or classrooms as quickly and safely as possible, while minimizing the risk of COVID-19. According to Hinshaw, more than 3,400 children and youth who were tested for COVID-19 reported having a sore throat. Just over 700 of them had a sore throat as their only symptom, and less than one per cent of their tests came back positive. Meanwhile, the number of cases of COVID-19 among school-aged children in Alberta has again surged to a new high, while the number of kids and teens being tested continues to decline. Data from Alberta Health shows the number of new daily cases has continued to rise among five- to nine-year-olds and has again shot up, especially, among 10- to 19-year-olds. Last week on record, an average of 85 cases were recorded per day among school-aged kids and teens.",
